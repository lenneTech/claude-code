# Issue

## Description
Work on a single assigned issue, ensuring high-quality, consistent implementation and adherence to all requirements.

## Prompt
### STEP 1: ISSUE ANALYSIS & PLANNING (30-45 min thinking time)

1.  **Retrieve Issue Details:** Access the Management Control Panel (MCP) to retrieve the specific Linear Issue **#$ARGUMENTS** and any associated resources (e.g., a Figma design link).
2.  **Understand Requirements:** Deeply read the issue description, comments, and review the Figma design (if applicable) to fully grasp the objective, scope, and visual requirements.
3.  **Consistency Check:** Review existing application code in relevant areas to understand current implementation patterns, architecture, and coding styles. The new code **must** be consistent.
4.  **Create Plan:** Develop a concrete implementation plan, including:
    * Required code changes/new files.
    * Approach for handling edge cases.
    * Testing strategy for the new feature/fix.

### STEP 2: EXECUTION

Implement the plan completely, focused on high quality and consistency:

1.  **Implement:** Write production-quality code that directly addresses the issue requirements.
2.  **Consistency & Guidelines:** Strictly adhere to established coding guidelines and ensure the implementation style is consistent with the surrounding application code.
3.  **Testing:** Implement unit/integration tests as defined in the plan, or manually test the feature thoroughly.
4.  **Update Status:** Update the Linear Issue **#$ARGUMENTS** status in the MCP upon completion.

**Only interrupt for critical blockers** (e.g., unclear requirements, missing credentials). Make smart decisions autonomously, prioritizing code quality and long-term maintainability.

**Expected time:**
* Small Issue/Bugfix: 1-3 hours.
* Feature Implementation: 3+ hours (adjust time based on complexity).
