# Full Build (Plan + Build in One Go)

## Description
Plan + Build in one go (no interruption).

## Prompt
Complete implementation of SPEC.md from scratch.

### STEP 1: PLANNING (minimum 20-30 min thinking time)

Read SPEC.md deeply and create **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** with:
-  Architecture decisions & rationale
-  Tech stack choices
-  File structure
-  Implementation order with dependencies
-  Edge cases to handle
-  Testing strategy

Ultrathink and through: What's the cleanest, most maintainable way to build this?

### STEP 2: EXECUTION (minimum 1-3+ hours)

Follow your plan:
-  Implement each phase completely!
-  Write production-quality code
-  Update SPEC.md checkboxes
-  Handle errors properly
-  Add necessary comments

Only interrupt for critical blockers. Make smart decisions autonomously. Dont stop until done.

**BEGIN PLANNING NOW.**
