## Execution Protocol

### Package Manager Detection

Before executing any commands, detect the project's package manager:

```bash
ls pnpm-lock.yaml yarn.lock package-lock.json 2>/dev/null
```

| Lockfile | Package Manager | Run scripts | Execute binaries | Audit command |
|----------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| `pnpm-lock.yaml` | `pnpm` | `pnpm run X` | `pnpm dlx X` | `pnpm audit` |
| `yarn.lock` | `yarn` | `yarn run X` | `yarn dlx X` | `yarn audit` |
| `package-lock.json` / none | `npm` | `npm run X` | `npx X` | `npm audit` |

### Phase 1: Permission Model Audit (Backend/Fullstack)

The nest-server 3-layer permission model is the primary security mechanism.

#### Layer 1: @Restricted (Class-Level Fallback)

Every controller MUST have `@Restricted(RoleEnum.ADMIN)`:

```bash
# Find controllers without @Restricted
grep -rn "class.*Controller" src/server/modules/
# Verify @Restricted exists above each
```

- Missing `@Restricted` = **CRITICAL** (all endpoints unprotected by default)

#### Layer 2: @Roles (Method-Level Override)

Every endpoint MUST have explicit `@Roles()`:

```bash
grep -rn "@(Get|Post|Put|Delete|Patch)\(" src/server/modules/
# Verify @Roles exists above each endpoint
```

- Missing `@Roles` = endpoint falls back to `@Restricted` (ADMIN only)
- Check: Is fallback intentional or accidental?

#### Layer 3: securityCheck()

Every Model extending `CoreModel`/`CorePersisted` MUST declare `securityCheck(user, force)`. `CoreModel` provides a default `return this` — this is the intentional "no per-Model restrictions" state. A trivial/default `securityCheck` is **legitimate when the Model genuinely has nothing to filter**, but requires active evaluation.

```bash
# Models that must have securityCheck
grep -rn "extends CoreModel\|extends CorePersisted" src/server/modules/
# Find Models with default pass-through — OK only if no per-instance/ownership/state rules needed
grep -rn -A3 "securityCheck(" src/server/modules/ | grep -B1 "return this" | grep -v "if\|hasRole\|equalIds\|force"
```

**Proactive evaluation for every trivial `securityCheck`:** `securityCheck` is often the **only** place where certain authorization rules can live. For each Model with a default/trivial `securityCheck`, verify none of these apply before accepting it:
- **Ownership-dependent field visibility:** fields that should be visible to the record owner but not to other users of the same role (ownership is not expressible via `@Restricted` roles).
- **Relationship-dependent visibility:** fields/records visible only to members, shared-with users, or linked entities.
- **State-dependent visibility:** fields that depend on `status`, `published`, `visibility` flags of the Model itself.
- **Conditional record hiding in lists:** situations where a user may see some entries in a query result but not others — only `return undefined` from `securityCheck` can hide the entity without leaking its existence via pagination counts.
- **Cross-field rules:** visibility of one field depending on the value of another (`email` hidden unless `profile.public === true`).

If any of these apply AND `securityCheck` is still trivial, **this is itself a finding** — the Model is missing authorization logic that has no other natural implementation site.

**Severity depends on actual access restrictions AND the proactive evaluation:**

| Scenario | Severity |
|----------|----------|
| Missing `securityCheck` declaration entirely on a Model extending CoreModel/CorePersisted (no inherited default either) | **HIGH** |
| Model has role-restricted fields / `hideField: true` / ownership model, but `securityCheck` is the default `return this` without override | **HIGH** — the Model's own authorization rules never run; rely only on controller `@Roles` + interceptor secret-stripping |
| Proactive evaluation reveals per-instance/ownership/state/relationship/cross-field rule that belongs in `securityCheck` but is missing | **HIGH** — missing authorization control, OWASP A01 |
| Overridden `securityCheck` grants access but fails to clear fields the user should not see (`this.restrictedField = undefined`) for partial grants | **HIGH** — Broken Access Control (OWASP A01) |
| Overridden `securityCheck` has ownership check but no role escalation path (or vice versa) | **MEDIUM** — partial coverage |
| Default pass-through `return this` on a Model where proactive evaluation confirms no per-instance/ownership/state/relationship/cross-field rules exist | Allowed — intentional framework default |

Cross-reference: Models without override combined with controller-level `@Roles(S_EVERYONE)` or `S_USER` on an endpoint returning them is where data leaks materialize. If endpoint is restricted to `ADMIN` anyway, a pass-through `securityCheck` has no practical effect.

#### Layer 3b: Prefer Model Instances in Responses — Plain Objects Lose Model-Specific securityCheck

Instance of the **Informed-Trade-off Pattern** (same meta-pattern as Layer 6 foreign `@InjectModel` and Deprecation-scan phase). Full definition: `generating-nest-servers` skill, `reference/informed-trade-off-pattern.md` and Rule 13. Cross-reference Layer 6: a single call site can bypass `securityCheck` via both a plain-object return path AND a foreign `@InjectModel` — inspect call sites that trigger both.

The `CheckSecurityInterceptor` walks the controller response and calls `securityCheck(user, force)` on every object that provides it. Plain objects (from `.lean()`, `toObject()`, spreads, raw `aggregate()`, native-driver, manual literals) **lose the Model-specific `securityCheck` logic** — ownership checks, role-based field clearing, entity-specific rules do not run. **However**, the interceptor still applies `removeSecrets()` to plain objects (stripping configured `secretFields` — default: `password`, `verificationToken`, `passwordResetToken`, `refreshTokens`, `tempTokens`, plus any `security.secretFields` overrides) and still recurses via `processDeep` into nested items, reaching any Model instances inside. Plain objects are a trade-off, not an automatic leak.

```bash
# .lean() — plain-object path
grep -rn "\.lean(" src/server/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v ".spec.ts" | grep -v node_modules
# toObject()
grep -rn "\.toObject(" src/server/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v ".spec.ts"
# Spread of Mongoose docs into responses
grep -rn -B1 -A1 "return\s\+{" src/server/ --include="*.ts" | grep -E "\.\.\.[a-z]" | grep -v ".spec.ts"
# Raw aggregate() — returns plain objects
grep -rn "\.aggregate(" src/server/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v ".spec.ts"
```

**For each match on a user-facing path, verify:**
1. **Documented justification** in a comment (performance hot-path, projection, system-internal, or Model has only default `securityCheck`)?
2. **Hydration to Model instances** before return (`Model.map(raw)` / `new Model(raw)` / `results.map(raw => new MyModel(raw))`)?
3. **Manual replication** of the authorization rules `securityCheck` would have applied (ownership check, field clearing)?
4. **Referenced Model's actual restrictions** — if `securityCheck` is the default pass-through AND there are no role-restricted fields on the Model, the plain-object path has no authorization impact beyond losing extensibility.

| Scenario | Severity |
|----------|----------|
| `.lean()` / `toObject()` / spread / raw `aggregate()` in user-facing code, Model has non-trivial overridden `securityCheck`, no hydration, no manual replication, no justification | **HIGH** — Model-specific authorization lost, OWASP A01/A02 |
| Same as above but Model `securityCheck` is default pass-through AND fields are not role-restricted | **LOW / INFO** — framework-level `removeSecrets` still runs; no actual leak |
| Plain-object path with manual replication of authorization logic | Allowed (review completeness of replication) |
| Plain-object path with hydration back to Model instances before return | Allowed |
| Plain-object path in system-internal code (cron, processor, queue, WebSocket internal) with documented reason | Allowed |
| Plain-object path with documented justification + acknowledgement that Model-specific `securityCheck` does not run | Allowed |

#### Layer 4: Native MongoDB Driver Access

Direct native driver access bypasses ALL Mongoose plugins (Tenant, Audit, RoleGuard, Password).

**Type-level protection in the framework:** `ModuleService.mainDbModel` is typed as `SafeModel<T>` which is `Omit<Model<T>, 'collection' | 'db'>`. This means direct `this.mainDbModel.collection` and `this.mainDbModel.db` access **fails at compile time**. Legitimate native access goes through the helpers:
- `protected getNativeCollection(reason: string): Collection` — requires reason ≥20 chars, throws if shorter, logs `[SECURITY] Native collection access: <reason> (Model: <name>)`
- `protected getNativeConnection(reason: string): Connection` — same requirements, provides access to `.db` (native Db) and `.getClient()` (native MongoClient)

```bash
# Native helper usage (audit each for appropriateness)
grep -rn "getNativeCollection\|getNativeConnection" src/server/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v node_modules | grep -v ".spec.ts"
# Runtime-bypass attempts that would circumvent SafeModel typing (should be rare — any hit is suspicious)
grep -rn "as\s\+Model<\|as\s\+MongooseModel<\|as\s\+any[^A-Za-z]" src/server/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v node_modules | grep -v ".spec.ts" | grep -iE "collection|db\b"
# connection.db.collection() access (through getNativeConnection this is legitimate, but verify reason)
grep -rn '\.db\.collection(' src/server/ --include='*.ts' | grep -v node_modules
```

**Review rules:**
- `getNativeCollection(reason)` / `getNativeConnection(reason)` calls: verify each reason is meaningful (not "TODO", not "migration" alone — should name the specific operation, target collection, and why the safe path cannot be used). Framework enforces ≥20 chars but meaningful content is a review concern.
- `getNativeCollection` with WRITE on a tenant-scoped collection → **CRITICAL**: Tenant-Plugin bypassed, cross-tenant data leak risk
- `getNativeConnection` + `.db.collection('name')` READ-ONLY on schema-less collection (OAuth, BetterAuth, MCP session storage) → Allowed with reason
- `getNativeCollection`/`getNativeConnection` for Admin ops (createIndex, drop) → Allowed with reason
- Type-casts that circumvent `SafeModel` (`as Model<...>`, `as any`) reaching `.collection` / `.db` → **CRITICAL**: defeats the compile-time guard deliberately

#### Layer 5: Direct Mongoose Access Authorization Bypass

Direct Mongoose methods (`Model.create()`, `Model.findByIdAndUpdate()`, `Model.find().lean()`, `Model.aggregate()`) keep Mongoose plugins active (Tenant isolation preserved) but **bypass CrudService authorization** (`checkRights`, `@Restricted` enforcement, `S_CREATOR` ownership checks, secret field removal). Performance-motivated direct access is legitimate — but must be security-verified.

```bash
# Find direct Mongoose model access in user-facing code (controllers, resolvers)
grep -rn 'Model\.\(create\|find\|findOne\|findById\|updateOne\|updateMany\|deleteOne\|deleteMany\|bulkWrite\|insertMany\|aggregate\)' src/server/ --include='*.ts' | grep -v node_modules | grep -v '.spec.ts' | grep -v 'crud.service'
```

**For each direct access found, verify:**
1. **Authorization before access:** Is `user.hasRole()`, `equalIds(user, entity.createdBy)`, or equivalent check performed before the database call?
2. **Tenant isolation (only if project uses multi-tenancy):** Is the Mongoose Tenant plugin active on this model, or is tenant filtering manually applied? Skip if project has no Tenant plugin configured.
3. **Output filtering:** If the result is returned to a user, are `hideField: true` fields excluded?
4. **Context justification:** Is the bypass documented (performance, bulk ops, subdocument arrays, system-internal)?

| Scenario | Severity |
|----------|----------|
| Direct access in controller without prior authorization | **HIGH** — Broken Access Control (OWASP A01) |
| Direct access leaking sensitive fields to user response | **HIGH** — Sensitive Data Exposure (OWASP A02) |
| Direct access without tenant filter in multi-tenant project | **CRITICAL** — Tenant data leak |
| Direct access in system-internal code (cron, processor) | Allowed |
| Direct access with documented reason + authorization | Allowed |

#### Layer 6: @InjectModel Usage Audit (Foreign Models Only)

Instance of the **Informed-Trade-off Pattern** (same meta-pattern as Layer 3b plain objects and Deprecation-scan phase). Full definition: `generating-nest-servers` skill, `reference/informed-trade-off-pattern.md` and Rule 12. Cross-reference Layer 3b: a single call site can bypass `securityCheck` via both a foreign `@InjectModel` AND a plain-object return path — inspect call sites that trigger both.

**Scope:** This layer audits `@InjectModel` ONLY for Models that do NOT belong to the injecting Service. A Service's OWN primary Model (passed to `super({ mainDbModel })`) is the standard pattern and is not subject to this audit.

For every `@InjectModel` of a Model belonging to a different Service, the usage requires **justification** and **analysis of the corresponding Service** to ensure no processes or security measures are unintentionally bypassed. Direct Model access skips Service-level logic: `securityCheck()`, `@Restricted`/`@Roles` pre-checks, ownership checks (`S_CREATOR`), field-level permissions, secret-field removal, output sanitization, and lifecycle side-effects (hooks, events, audit, notifications).

```bash
# Find all @InjectModel usages
grep -rn "@InjectModel(" src/server/modules/ --include='*.ts' | grep -v node_modules | grep -v '.spec.ts'
```

**Classify each `@InjectModel` found:**
1. **Own primary Model:** The injected Model is passed to `super({ mainDbModel: thisModel })` in the same class → expected pattern, no further action.
2. **Foreign or non-primary Model:** Any other usage → requires audit (steps below).

**Audit protocol for non-primary `@InjectModel`:**
1. **Justification present?** Is there a code comment explaining WHY direct Model access is used instead of the corresponding Service (performance, bulk op, no Service exists, atomic operator not exposed by CrudService, system-internal context)?
2. **Read the corresponding Service.** Enumerate what it enforces: `securityCheck()`, permission/role pre-checks, ownership checks, field filtering, hooks, events, side-effects.
3. **Per Service measure, verify the bypass is safe in this call site's context** OR manually replicated in the calling code. Never assume direct Model access is "just a simple read" — confirm against the real Service.
4. **Write-path scrutiny:** Writes (`create`, `update`, `delete`, `bulkWrite`, `findOneAndUpdate`) demand the highest evidence — missing ownership or permission replication here almost always produces a finding.

| Scenario | Severity |
|----------|----------|
| Non-primary `@InjectModel` with no justification comment | **MEDIUM** — Code audit gap; requires analysis |
| Non-primary `@InjectModel` silently bypassing a Service permission/ownership check | **HIGH** — Broken Access Control (OWASP A01) |
| Non-primary `@InjectModel` + write op without replicating `securityCheck`/ownership | **CRITICAL** |
| Non-primary `@InjectModel` returning data to user without Service-level field filtering | **HIGH** — Sensitive Data Exposure (OWASP A02) |
| Non-primary `@InjectModel` with documented justification + audited-safe bypasses | Allowed |
| Own primary Model via `@InjectModel` | Allowed (expected pattern) |

#### Layer 7: Own-Model Direct Access Audit (Informed Trade-off — Rule 14)

Instance of the **Informed-Trade-off Pattern**. Complements Layer 5 (generic direct Mongoose security) and Layer 6 (foreign `@InjectModel`): Layer 5 focuses on the raw security impact, Layer 6 on foreign-Service bypass, Layer 7 on own-Model access that may silently skip CrudService authorization/side-effects. Full rule: `generating-nest-servers` skill, `reference/informed-trade-off-pattern.md` and `reference/security-rules.md` Rule 14.

**Scope:** calls inside a Service on its OWN primary Model — `this.mainDbModel.xxx` / `this.<modelName>Model.xxx` where the Model was passed to `super({ mainDbModel })`. The direct access is allowed, but requires an audit for unintentionally bypassed processes, skipped authorization, and missing side-effects.

```bash
# Own-Model direct access inside Service classes
grep -rn "this\.\(mainDbModel\|[a-zA-Z]*Model\)\.\(findOne\|findById\|find\|create\|updateOne\|updateMany\|findByIdAndUpdate\|findOneAndUpdate\|deleteOne\|deleteMany\|findByIdAndDelete\|bulkWrite\|insertMany\|aggregate\|countDocuments\)" src/server/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v ".spec.ts" | grep -v node_modules
```

**Security impact breakdown (what is bypassed):**
- CrudService `checkRestricted()` — field-level `@UnifiedField({ roles })` enforcement in the service layer
- `process()` normalization — input cloning, secret masking, population
- CrudService-emitted events / audit hooks — downstream consumers may silently miss notifications, cache invalidation, relation updates
- Ownership pre-checks (`S_CREATOR`)

**Security impact — what is NOT bypassed** (distinguishes from Layer 5 native driver):
- Mongoose-level plugins (Tenant, Audit, RoleGuard, Password)
- Model `securityCheck()` — still runs via the interceptor if the return reaches a controller response

**Audit protocol for each own-Model direct access found:**
1. **Justification comment present?** Names the reason (atomic op / aggregation / bulk / internal field / perf / subdoc array / system-internal)?
2. **Authorization:** does the path return to a user? If yes AND the Model has role-restricted `@UnifiedField({ roles })` fields → verify either a follow-up `super.update(id, {}, serviceOptions)` call OR manual field-filter.
3. **Input validation:** is the write payload already validated upstream (class-validator in controller), or is it service-built and needing explicit sanitization?
4. **Side-effects:** if downstream consumers depend on CrudService events/hooks, are they manually re-emitted at the call site?
5. **Mixing:** is the method consistent in its data-access style, or does it mix direct access with CrudService calls without documented reason?

| Scenario | Severity |
|----------|----------|
| Own-Model direct write + silent bypass of field-level `@Restricted` on user-facing response | **HIGH** — Broken Access Control (OWASP A01) |
| Own-Model direct access where `securityCheck` still runs via interceptor AND no role-restricted fields | **LOW** — trade-off accepted, note documentation gap if missing |
| Own-Model direct access without justification comment (any context) | **LOW/MEDIUM** — audit gap; escalate to Medium when the Model has role-restricted fields |
| Own-Model direct access + missing side-effect (event/hook) that downstream code expects | **MEDIUM** — consistency gap, likely bug |
| Own-Model direct access + follow-up `super.update` to rerun the pipeline | Allowed (preferred pattern) |
| Own-Model direct access with documented reason + completed 5-question analysis | Allowed |

#### Layer 8: CrudService Force/Raw Variants Audit (Rule 15)

Instance of the **Informed-Trade-off Pattern** with elevated risk because `Force` and `Raw` variants disable secret-removal and can leak credentials. Full rule: `reference/informed-trade-off-pattern.md` and `reference/security-rules.md` Rule 15.

**Scope:** calls to `*Force` or `*Raw` CrudService methods. Every CrudService method has these variants (source: `crud.service.ts`):
- **`*Force`** (`getForce`, `createForce`, `findForce`, `findOneForce`, `findAndCountForce`, `findAndUpdateForce`, `updateForce`, `deleteForce`, `readForce`, `aggregateForce`) — sets `config.force = true`, which disables `checkRights`, `checkRoles`, `removeSecrets`, and bypasses RoleGuard plugin (see `module.service.ts:147-156`).
- **`*Raw`** (`getRaw`, `createRaw`, `findRaw`, `findOneRaw`, `findAndCountRaw`, `findAndUpdateRaw`, `updateRaw`, `deleteRaw`, `readRaw`, `aggregateRaw`) — additionally sets `config.raw = true`, which nulls `prepareInput` AND `prepareOutput` entirely. No translations, no type mapping, no field selection processing.

```bash
# Find all *Force and *Raw calls
grep -rn "\.\(getForce\|createForce\|updateForce\|findForce\|findOneForce\|findAndCountForce\|findAndUpdateForce\|deleteForce\|readForce\|aggregateForce\|getRaw\|createRaw\|updateRaw\|findRaw\|findOneRaw\|findAndCountRaw\|findAndUpdateRaw\|deleteRaw\|readRaw\|aggregateRaw\)(" src/server/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v ".spec.ts" | grep -v node_modules
```

**Security impact:** results from `*Force`/`*Raw` may contain `password` hashes, `verificationToken`, `passwordResetToken`, `refreshTokens`, `tempTokens`, and any field with `hideField: true` — because `removeSecrets` does NOT run. This is by design for system-internal flows (credential verification needs the password hash; migrations need raw data). The risk materializes when the result travels to a user-facing response.

**For every `*Force` or `*Raw` call found, trace the return value:**
1. **Does the result travel to a controller response?** If yes → **Critical** finding unless the calling method explicitly strips sensitive fields before the return.
2. **Was authorization verified upstream?** Since `checkRights` is skipped, the caller must have explicitly verified the current user's permission (via `user.hasRole()`, `equalIds()`, or equivalent) BEFORE the call. Missing upstream authorization = High.
3. **Is `*Raw` used where `*Force` would suffice?** `*Raw` additionally disables translations and type mapping — use it only when the untouched DB shape is required (e.g. comparing hashes).
4. **Is there a justification comment?** Framework convention requires documenting WHY the standard variant cannot be used.

| Scenario | Severity |
|----------|----------|
| `*Force`/`*Raw` result (including password hash / tokens) returned to a user-facing endpoint without explicit field stripping | **CRITICAL** — Sensitive Data Exposure (OWASP A02), credential leak |
| `*Force`/`*Raw` without upstream authorization check (caller does not verify `user.hasRole()` / `equalIds()` before the call) | **HIGH** — Broken Access Control (OWASP A01) |
| `*Force`/`*Raw` without justification comment in any context | **MEDIUM** — audit gap |
| `*Raw` used where `*Force` would suffice (over-bypassing) | **LOW** — defense-in-depth loss |
| `*Force` in documented credential-verification flow (needs password hash) | Allowed |
| `*Force`/`*Raw` in documented migration/backfill/seed script | Allowed |
| `*Force` in documented admin tooling where ADMIN role is verified upstream | Allowed |

#### Permissions Scanner

```bash
lt server permissions --failOnWarnings
```

| Warning | Severity |
|---------|----------|
| `NO_RESTRICTION` | CRITICAL |
| `NO_ROLES` | HIGH |
| `NO_SECURITY_CHECK` | HIGH |
| `UNRESTRICTED_FIELD` | MEDIUM |
| `UNRESTRICTED_METHOD` | HIGH |

### Phase 2: Injection Prevention (Backend/Fullstack)

#### NoSQL Injection

```bash
# Raw MongoDB operations with potential user input
grep -rn "\$where\|\.aggregate(\|JSON\.parse.*req\.\|JSON\.parse.*body\|JSON\.parse.*query" src/server/
```

- Flag: `$where` with user input, `.aggregate()` with unsanitized pipeline, `JSON.parse(userInput)` in queries

#### Command Injection

```bash
grep -rn "child_process\|\.exec(\|\.execSync(\|\.spawn(\|eval(\|new Function(" src/server/
```

#### Path Traversal

```bash
grep -rn "fs\.readFile\|fs\.writeFile\|fs\.unlink\|path\.join.*req\.\|path\.join.*body" src/server/
```

- Flag: File operations with user-controlled paths without `path.basename` sanitization

#### Input Validation Gaps

For every CreateInput/UpdateInput in changed files:
- Verify `@IsNotEmpty()`, `@IsString()`/`@IsNumber()`, `@Min()`/`@Max()`, `@IsEmail()`, `@IsEnum()`
- Verify ObjectId params validated with `Types.ObjectId.isValid()`

### Phase 3: XSS & Frontend Security (Frontend/Fullstack)

#### Direct XSS Vectors

```bash
grep -rn "v-html\|innerHTML\|eval(\|document\.write\|new Function(" app/
```

| Pattern | Severity |
|---------|----------|
| `v-html` with user data | CRITICAL |
| `innerHTML` assignment | CRITICAL |
| `eval()` / `new Function()` | CRITICAL |
| `:href` with unvalidated URLs | HIGH |
| Dynamic component from user input | HIGH |

#### Safe Pattern Verification

- `{{ }}` text interpolation (auto-escaped by Vue)
- `v-html` only with DOMPurify-sanitized content
- `:href` URLs validated against protocol allowlist (`http`/`https`)

### Phase 4: Auth & Session Security

#### Backend Auth

- [ ] Better Auth base path: `/iam`
- [ ] Cookie flags: `httpOnly=true`, `secure=true`, `sameSite=strict`
- [ ] Password hashing via Better Auth (bcrypt/SHA256)
- [ ] Token expiry configured
- [ ] Logout invalidates server-side session
- [ ] Failed login doesn't reveal which credential is wrong
- [ ] Rate limiting on auth endpoints

#### Frontend Auth

- [ ] `useBetterAuth()` for auth — no custom auth
- [ ] `authClient.useSession(useFetch)` — always with `useFetch` for SSR
- [ ] Protected routes: `definePageMeta({ middleware: 'auth' })`
- [ ] No tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`
- [ ] No sensitive data in `useState` beyond ID/email/displayName
- [ ] `useRuntimeConfig()` for config — never `process.env` client-side

```bash
# Tokens in localStorage
grep -rn "localStorage\|sessionStorage" app/
# process.env in frontend
grep -rn "process\.env" app/
```

### Phase 5: Data Exposure & Secrets

```bash
# Hardcoded secrets
grep -rn "password=\|secret=\|apiKey=\|token=" --include="*.ts" --include="*.yml" --include="*.json" .
# .env committed
git ls-files | grep "\.env$"
# JWT secret length (check .env.example)
grep "JWT_SECRET\|BETTER_AUTH_SECRET" .env.example
```

- [ ] No passwords/tokens in API responses (check model serialization, `hideField: true`)
- [ ] No stack traces in error messages (production)
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] Database connection strings not in source code
- [ ] JWT/auth secrets >= 64 characters
- [ ] `.env` in `.gitignore`
- [ ] `.env.example` has ONLY placeholder values

#### Layer 5b: Error-Response Information Disclosure (ErrorCode Enforcement)

Raw-string exceptions are a **classic OWASP A01/A09 vector**: they frequently leak SQL fragments, stacktrace details, file paths, internal IDs, or user-enumeration signals through the HTTP response body. The `@lenne.tech/nest-server` framework solves this via the typed `ErrorCode` registry — every exception returns `#PREFIX_XXXX: Developer message`, translated client-side via `GET /i18n/errors/:locale`. Full rules: `generating-nest-servers` skill → `reference/error-handling.md`.

```bash
# Raw-string exceptions in production code — every hit is a potential disclosure vector
grep -rnE "throw new (BadRequest|Unauthorized|Forbidden|NotFound|Conflict|UnprocessableEntity|InternalServerError)Exception\(\s*['\"\`]" src/server/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v ".spec.ts" | grep -v ".test.ts" | grep -v node_modules

# Template-literal exceptions interpolating runtime state — highest-risk leak pattern
grep -rnE "throw new .*Exception\(\s*\`" src/server/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v ".spec.ts" | grep -v node_modules

# Framework ErrorCode imported (should be from project registry, not framework)
grep -rn "import .*ErrorCode.* from '@lenne.tech/nest-server'" src/server/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v node_modules

# Registry wiring in every env config
grep -c "additionalErrorRegistry" src/config.env.ts || echo "MISSING: additionalErrorRegistry not found in config"
```

**For every raw-string exception found, trace what is interpolated:**
1. Does the string include `error.message`, `err.stack`, `query`, `sql`, variables from `req`, DB identifiers, user input, or file paths? → Information Disclosure (High/Critical depending on content).
2. Does it differentiate "user not found" vs "invalid password"? → User enumeration (Medium-High).
3. Does it include sanitization context (e.g. file path that was rejected)? → Path disclosure aids traversal attempts (Medium).
4. Is it a pure static string like `'Invalid request'`? → Still violates the NON-NEGOTIABLE ErrorCode rule (Medium — contract/i18n break) but not itself a disclosure.

**Severity (this layer specifically):**

| Scenario | Severity |
|----------|----------|
| Raw-string exception interpolating SQL/query/stacktrace/file path into response body | **CRITICAL** — OWASP A09 Security Logging/Monitoring Failures + A05 Security Misconfiguration |
| Auth flow returns different messages for "user not found" vs "wrong password" (user enumeration) | **HIGH** — OWASP A07 Identification & Authentication Failures |
| Raw-string exception leaking internal IDs, tenant IDs, or internal state to a user with insufficient role | **HIGH** — OWASP A01 Broken Access Control |
| Raw-string static exception without interpolation (e.g. `'Invalid file type'`) | **MEDIUM** — violates the NON-NEGOTIABLE ErrorCode rule + i18n contract |
| `ErrorCode` imported from `@lenne.tech/nest-server` instead of project registry | **MEDIUM** — project codes invisible, diverges over time |
| Missing `additionalErrorRegistry: ProjectErrors` in one or more env configs | **MEDIUM** — silent translation drop per env |
| Duplicate code numbers across `LtnsErrors` + `ProjectErrors` | **HIGH** — merge-order collision, unpredictable behavior |
| `PROJ_*` code renamed or recycled in a release | **HIGH** — public API contract break |
| All exceptions use typed `ErrorCode`, registry wired in every env, zero raw strings | Allowed |

**Cross-references:**
- Backend enforcement: `backend-reviewer` Phase 4 (ErrorCode Usage Check) — ensures the registry exists and is wired.
- Test-side: `test-reviewer` Phase 2 (ErrorCode Assertions) — ensures tests assert codes, not message strings.
- Frontend consumption: `frontend-reviewer` (Error Handling via `useLtErrorTranslation`) — ensures the translation layer is used.

### Phase 6: Dependency Audit

Use the detected package manager to run audit in each subproject:

```bash
# Backend (substitute detected PM)
cd projects/api && pnpm audit 2>/dev/null || npm audit 2>/dev/null || yarn audit 2>/dev/null
# Frontend (substitute detected PM)
cd projects/app && pnpm audit 2>/dev/null || npm audit 2>/dev/null || yarn audit 2>/dev/null
```

| Audit severity | Report severity |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| critical | CRITICAL |
| high | HIGH |
| moderate | MEDIUM |
| low | LOW |

### Phase 7: Infrastructure Security (Docker, Env, CORS)

- [ ] No secrets in Dockerfiles or docker-compose files
- [ ] Non-root `USER` in production Dockerfiles
- [ ] Base images pinned (no `:latest`)
- [ ] `.dockerignore` excludes: `.env`, `node_modules`, `.git`
- [ ] CORS not set to `*` — explicit origin list
- [ ] Helmet configured (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, nosniff)
- [ ] MongoDB port NOT exposed in production compose
- [ ] Database names differ per environment

## Severity Classification

| Severity | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **CRITICAL** | RCE, auth bypass, missing @Restricted, injection, data breach | Fix immediately, block deploy |
| **HIGH** | Privilege escalation, stored XSS, missing securityCheck, IDOR | Fix before merge |
| **MEDIUM** | CSRF gaps, missing rate limiting, info disclosure, missing validation | Fix within sprint |
| **LOW** | Missing security headers, verbose dev errors, minor config | Track and fix |
| **INFO** | Hardening suggestions, best practices | Optional |

## Output Format

### Permission Model Coverage (Backend/Fullstack)
| Module | @Restricted | @Roles Coverage | securityCheck | Status |
|--------|------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| User   | ADMIN      | 5/5             | yes           | PASS   |
| Product| MISSING    | 3/5             | no            | FAIL   |

### Findings

#### [SEC-001] CRITICAL — Missing @Restricted on ProductController
- **Location:** `src/server/modules/product/product.controller.ts:12`
- **Category:** OWASP A01 — Broken Access Control
- **Impact:** All endpoints unprotected by default
- **Remediation:**
  ```typescript
  // BEFORE
  @Controller('api/products')
  export class ProductController {

  // AFTER
  @Restricted(RoleEnum.ADMIN)
  @Controller('api/products')
  export class ProductController {
  ```

#### [SEC-002] HIGH — v-html with user content
- **Location:** `app/components/CommentCard.vue:24`
- ...

### Dependency Audit
| Package | Severity | CVE | Fix Available |
|---------|----------|-----|---------------|

### Remediation Priority
1. [CRITICAL — immediate]
2. [HIGH — before merge]
3. [MEDIUM — this sprint]
4. [LOW — backlog]
```

## FORBIDDEN During Review

- **NEVER** suggest removing `@Restricted` to fix test failures
- **NEVER** suggest weaker `@Roles` to simplify access
- **NEVER** suggest bypassing `securityCheck()`
- **NEVER** suggest `localStorage` for token storage
- **NEVER** classify auth/permission gaps below HIGH
- **NEVER** accept CORS `*` configuration
- **NEVER** accept secrets in source code at any severity

## Error Recovery

| Issue | Workaround |
|-------|------------|
| Permissions scanner unavailable | Manual Grep for @Restricted, @Roles, securityCheck |
| Audit command fails | Try `--registry https://registry.npmjs.org` |
| Cannot access project dir | Report scope limitation, audit accessible files only |
| Ambiguous finding | Classify conservatively (higher severity) |
